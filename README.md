1st-Order Markov Chain.maxpat was used for the purposes of analyzing pitch proximity and step declination, and generated matrixes of interval sizes and frequencies. 

2nd-Order Markov Chain.maxpat was used to analyze step inertia and post-skip reversal by generating matrixes of second-order pitch frequencies.

Pitch List.maxpat tracked every pitch played within the melody and output those results into a list.

music_analysis.py contained five different functions for each principle, which all received these matrixes as input and manipulated them accordingly to provide counts. 

The base code for all Max/MSP patches was very courteously and helpfully provided by course instructor Jeremy Wagner of UC Berkeley. All of the results generated by these files
were incorporated into my final project essay for the course Music 108.
